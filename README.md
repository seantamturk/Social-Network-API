## Description

The Social Network API is an exercise in back-end development, focusing on a NoSQL database model built with MongoDB and Mongoose, and utilizing Express.js for routing. This project demonstrates proficiency in building and structuring a social network API capable of managing large amounts of unstructured data. The application allows for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users and thoughts, as well as adding and removing friends and reactions. This challenge has been a great opportunity for me as a developer, reinforcing the principles of NoSQL databases, learning how to implement Mongoose ODM, and improving my skills in routing with Express.js. Completing this task has not only augmented my abilities in these areas but has also provided me with practical skills applicable to the development of social network applications.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
- THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
